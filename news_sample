The West, wrote Stegner -- who was born in 1909 in Iowa and grew up in Montana, Utah and elsewhere before settling in Northern California's Los Altos Hills until his death in 1993 -- was a place defined by its restlessness. It was a region, in other words, from which people largely moved on, with considerable literary consequences.

The opposite also is true. For example, Martin Scorsese's "Shine a Light" was good and I like the Rolling Stones, but would have been far better had Mick and the boys provided more personal access.

What would make anticipating pride so much better than anticipating shame in controlling temptation? One reason is that pride focuses attention on the self (not the cake) and on success rather than failure. Shame, on the other hand, emphasizes the opposite; it focuses attention on the object of desire and the act of succumbing, making resistance harder to pull off. Simply put, anticipating pride makes us feel good, and anticipating shame makes us feel bad.

My first reaction when a copy of Paul Dickson's new biography, "Bill Veeck: Baseball's Greatest Maverick," lands in my lap is to be curious if justice has been done to him, before turning a single page. I touch base with Mike Veeck, the great man's son (a man of a few radical and wonderfully ridiculous notions of his own), to inquire if the descendants approve. "We've read it and enjoyed the easy flow and the research," Mike replies. "Mr. Dickson has won me over with his gentle prose."

J Mello describes himself as a rapper, but he sings straight through "Torture," a guitar-pop song about his girlfriend's serial cheating. Get set for a narrative as linear as a bullet train, and where it's heading is nowhere you'd want to be: unable to quit a lover who keeps messing around with your buddies.

Lloyd: I don’t know if the rest world will ever catch up to me because I don’t know where the hell I am most the time. If you notice, almost every TV commercial lately has ukulele in it. The ukulele is now being taken more seriously. It’s not a just novelty instrument or a1920’s nostalgia trip, but an important member of the string family used in classical, jazz, folk, rock, etc. I like Tiny Tim but enough of the “Tiptoe Through the Tulip” requests. That’s like a guitarist getting, “Dude, play Freebird!” (which I get as well). But it’s no surprise to me that more people are getting turned on to the pure sound of the ukulele. That’s why I love it so much - it has a weak sound but in the right hands it can sound powerful. I think because rock music relied so heavily on the guitar, you figure at some point it may have been stretched to the limit. But making folk or orchestra instruments as lead rock instruments could have endless possibilities in that genre. I hope to hear more in the future. As for the Jew’s harp, the other uke player in Lloyd United, Riri Hamilton, plays a mean one.

The Jets have drafted a running back each year under Rex Ryan: Shonn Greene in 2009, Joe McKnight and John Conner in 2010 and Bilal Powell in 2011. But with veteran LaDainian Tomlinson not expected to be back, the Jets still have a need at the position. If Alabama’s Trent Richardson is still on the board at No. 16, the Jets would be lucky to ground and pound with him, but the talented back is not expected to last nearly that long. They could instead address the position in a later round (Utah State’s Robert Turbin and Michael Smith both visited Florham Park), adding another young runner to the mix as they see if McKnight and Powell can grow into larger roles.

The sudden back and forth suggested that the controversy he started -- drawing pointed criticisms from President Barack Obama and an array of leaders, officials and celebrities in the United States and abroad -- was not yet finished even after multiple appearances before the news media on the lawn of his small church. Jones seemed to be struggling with how to save face and hold onto the spotlight he has attracted for an act that could make him a widely reviled figure.

David Breskin recruited Frisell for the Richter project because he sensed parallels between the painter and the guitarist.

Blintzes, the Jewish pancakes that wrap around a sweet or savory filling, are equivalent to crepes, although they probably originated in Poland, and the name derives from Russian blini. We know blini as tiny, thin pancakes used to prop up caviar and creme fraiche, but they had their start in the Middle Ages as buckwheat disks and evolved over the centuries into more refined creations lightened up with yeast and whipped egg whites.

Again, this is perhaps the only questions that matters: Do we stay addicted to our patterns and our former selves, or do we harness the difficult opportunities when we see them, when the chance for change swims into view, knowing they won't wait around for long, knowing, deep down, that if we ignore them the energy will stagnate and congeal into fear and fat, misery and fundamentalist Republican Christianity, never to have hot sex again?

EAST HARTFORD, Conn. — The game itself was one of those soul-crushing defeats you wouldn’t wish on your worst enemy, so that — by default — becomes the lasting memory of 2011. That’s the one they’ll take into this bonus month of silent BCS torture. That’s the only recollection that matters, because this is what college football is supposed to be — a dozen individual bloody lessons in search of one happy theme that almost always add up to misery.

For Lynn, the lockdown extended a run in which he has allowed only 10 hits and three earned runs in 19 innings. Friday's 84-pitch outing accounted for most of the Pirates' frustration on a night when they never took an at-bat with a runner in scoring position. Lynn insists he doesn't know his numbers - a 1.42 ERA and nearly twice as many strikeouts (17) as hits allowed. He does know that a more aggressive pitching style serves him better than the nibbler's style he attempted in two starts last season.

And that’s why both Carter and Obama came to seem so tired, dull, repetitive, scolding, inept and irrelevant. Carter’s poll numbers went up immediately after the malaise speech but retreated after a few days. His words gave him an anti-halo — the shadow of a whiner.
Greg had had some injury problems, but nothing like we’ve seen here. He was coming off playing great in the NCAA championships. He was basically a one-man show with Mike Conley. So, we would have done the same thing.

When the Vatican ruled parishes in the diocese which were closed in 2010 must be reopened since Bishop Richard Lennon did not follow proper procedures when closing these churches, it was widely believed St. Margaret Mary was among those churches on their way to being reopened.

In 2000, Kwon bought a Manhattan condominium with his wife and took out a mortgage for $650,000, and New York City property records show he still owns it. The city declined to disclose the sale price because those records were not open to the public at the time of the sale.

Barry Bonds always will be a Hall of Fame candidate. He surely is one of the 10 best players of his generation and probably several others. But will he be a Hall of Famer? That is a question I don't have to worry about answering for another three years or so, until he would become eligible. The biggest question of all, though, may be how would the Hall of Famers receive Bonds if he were elected?. My guess is not very well. American is a forgiving nation but Bonds, and for that matter, Roger Clemens, have shown very little if any contrition for their actions or suspected actions. That creates the sense that they feel they are bigger than the game. And they're not.
"I'd like to stay focused on issues. I certainly am through this budget," he said. "That's my primary issue, we'll all get focused on the fall (presidential) campaign and then we'll be into 2009 and that's the time we'll have to make our decision."

The amendment by Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., would bar any private insurance company from offering plans to cover abortion if they receive federal subsidies.

Although the urban hustle and bustle remain, an increasingly tense and eerie feeling permeates the air.

That night, I watched LeBron be LeBron in Detroit. Late in the third quarter, he did what I didn't think was possible in a real game: go basket-to-basket in four dribbles. When I first reviewed the tape, I thought my eyes were lying to me. I kept replaying it. Four, four, four. Absolutely amazing. And I truly don't think he walked.
Nopales, the cactus, is unquestionably healthful, a source of vitamin C and potassium and bioflavonoids. Tortillas made with nopales taste basically like tortillas, although when it is time for a second round of tortillas, you may well opt for the regular ones, which are somewhat less puddingy inside. Cactus may well cure every disease you throw at it, as well as conquering childhood obesity and providing valuable manganese, but you are not going to change your lifestyle in one night.

However, the longtime Houston Astro needed to reaffirm to himself that he retained the production that has made him a six-time All-Star.

øThe goal is to accumulate the most points possible before filling up the grid. The game randomly generates objects for you to place on the grid.

While many people, Ms. Campbell included, subscribe to the belief that life begins at conception, many other people, including Christians, Jews and non-religious people, are not so certain. It is clearly not acceptable in a free and secular society for Ms. Campbell and her supporters to use the power of the state to impose their religious beliefs upon those of us who believe differently - unless, of course, Ms. Campbell can prove scientifically exactly when a fertilized egg becomes "human."

So, yeah, there’s a Ben Stiller comedy (“Neighborhood Watch”) another self-promoting Tyler Perry movie (“Tyler Perry’s The Matchmaker”) and further who-asked-for-‘em sequels to “Ice Age” and “Step Up.” Oh, and “Ted,” a twisted comedy with Mark Wahlberg and a talking teddy bear that sounds like “The Beaver,” only less so.
The press for large donors by both parties has intensified in the wake of recent Supreme Court rulings that allow individuals and corporations to spend unlimited sums on independent campaign efforts. The importance of independent efforts was underscored Friday when Crossroads GPS, a group founded by Bush advisor Karl Rove and other Republicans, announced the Monday start to a $20-million advertising campaign targeting Obama and other Democrats.

And that seems fine. I tell him I'd like to be there.
By the fall, the deteriorating economy had broadened the thirst for change from a base of Democratic Party regulars and anti-war activists to encompass a majority of the electorate. McCain's only chances for victory slipped away as the success of the surge he championed in Iraq was obscured by the economic collapse here at home. But looking back to the pivotal moments along the primary campaign trail last spring, it's clear that neither candidate could have possibly come this far without challenging their parties' conventional wisdom on a war that -- to most Americans -- barely seems to matter anymore.
I'm not saying we've figured out the model for newspapers. Facebook is a small, easily managed group compared to the public at large. But I do think we're on to something.

Most readers know Natalie Babbitt for her fantasy, "Tuck Everlasting." This story, set in a small town in Ohio in the 1960s, has no magic. Joe Casimir, ready for junior high, has always lived with his grandmother, but he's packed off to Aunt Myra while Gran recovers from hip replacement. Though the setting is carefully dated (no Internet, no cellphones), the realities of Joe's life -- the way he doesn't talk about his dreams for life, the excitement of finding new friends (including Beatrice and her dog, Rover) -- speak directly to children today. The moon, changing but in a dependable way, presides over Midville. Not even the richest man in town can buy that. Good for family talk.
This season, as the replacement for the injured Fister, Adam Wilk didn't make a quality start in his three starts. By far his most unsuccessful came Wednesday night, when he lasted two innings and allowed six runs to Seattle.

“We’re not writing him out of Denver’s game yet,” McMillan said. “Until he gets back to Portland and visits with the doctors and those guys take a look at him and see how he feels, we’re not going to make any decisions. (The game) is a couple days away. We’ll see how he feels and what he’s thinking and we’ll decide if it’s best for him to play or sit for a few games. That’s more of a medical call than making that decision now.”

Gerald Wixted, an attorney for the Kotsovska family, argued the woman’s job was more akin to an independent contractor who would not be covered under worker's compensation and is therefore entitled to bring suit.

Lucy, an aging German shorthair, stood rigid as a statue, her stubbed tail plank straight as she locked onto the scent of chukar partridge seeking cover in the summer switchgrass. From a distance, the stalemate appeared common enough among the upland bird community with a preference for running with pointing breeds. But from dog owner Buzz Butler's vantage point at Lucy's flank, the view was nothing short of astounding.

Wal-Mart said results are improving because U.S. customers are beginning to respond to its turnaround strategies. After consumers balked at popular brand names and other merchandise they want being missing from store shelves, the company has been restocking those items that it had scrapped in an overzealous move to clean up stores.

ø- Like Plural Eyes, Apple wants to sync up the various cameras (you can use up to 9 cameras) by using the audio to line them up. But what if, say, you have great sound on camera #1, but the other cameras are using the natural sound provided by their internal (and usually very lousy) microphones? If so, you don't do as well. You will need to put a microphone - a shotgun, a lavalier - anything, to help each camera record sound if you want Apple's Multicamera option to perform at its best.
At Big Planet, owned by Jeff and Paige Gehris, recyling, green elements and food share the spotlight. Visitors are greeted out front by an industrial metal base for the restaurant's signature globe.

I am voting "yes" for the Affton ambulance referendum. It's very important. I don't care about the cost or politics. It's my life on the line.

Luck makes few mistakes and works constantly to improve. Tall and strong, he has the size to take a hit and is not afraid to stand in the pocket and make a throw with pass rushers bearing down on him. While lacking the exceptional athleticism of Heisman Trophy winner Robert Griffin III, Luck is a deceptively mobile QB who rushed for 957 yards in his college career, and he can make throws and accurate reads while on the run. The scouting combine only confirmed his standing as the top player available in the draft. He ran the 40-yard dash in 4.67 seconds - fourth among quarterbacks - and finished first in the broad jump (10 feet, 4 inches), third in the three-cone drill (6.80 seconds) and fifth in the 20-yard shuttle (4.28) at his position. He earned an overall grade of 97.0 on a scale with a maximum of 100. Luck has no clear weaknesses and could be a once-in-a-generation talent, and he'll likely start right away for the team that selects him.

Gretchen teases Casanova, telling him she decided to call him her bosom buddy because they're so close. He doesn't seem to get the bosom body part reference, and suggests, well how about they be hip buddies instead.

The players have said all the right things in welcoming Marshall into the mix, but that's because the perception is that this is a clean slate for the troubled receiver. If that slate starts to get mucked up with more reports of domestic disputes or disturbances in clubs, Emery's first big acquisition could be more headache than big splash.

Since the 1960s, the largest existing Chinatown between San Francisco and Los Angeles, the Salinas enclave, has been boarded up and has become the orbit of prostitution, gambling, drug dealers and illegal dumping. In the mix are a Confucian temple and a Japanese Buddhist temple. With the determination to redevelop Chinatown, Salinas organizations and students from California State University, Monterey Bay, who teach the homeless how to grow sustainable gardens, are slowly seeing a revival. The community, comprising people of all ethnic backgrounds  Latino, Filipino, Japanese among others  has taken up the cause. Their intention is to make this area a safe, livable, pedestrian-friendly mixed-use development with the old Republic Café at its heart, to become a museum where stories can be passed down in a continuum from old-timers to another generation.

"I think I have stayed at Joe's because it is such a special and unique place to work." Kiniris said. "Every day is an exciting challenge for me as a person with a passion for the restaurant industry. I thrive on the energy of the business and love that we have resisted the pressures on our business to follow a corporate model. Our owners treat all of the employees with a tremendous amount of respect and gratitude.

More seriously, he said, "What I've noticed so far is that when I see a guy wide open, I'll try to rush it. So then my footwork doesn't get right. I don't continue my whole drop, and I get out of rhythm because I see him so open I just want to get it to him. And that's something I need to work on."

OBT has, in addition to Wu, three dancers capable of performing Giselle, Yuka Iino, Xuan Cheng and Rowe, who gets a crack at it at the children's matinee next Saturday with Brian Simcoe. That's remarkable for a company this size and a tribute to artistic director Christopher Stowell's leadership.
But sometimes there's no difference. Lake knows the odds, a 30 percent survival rate within five years, and knows that the new lesion on his liver could mean nothing serious or more chemotherapy or something worse. He goes back in for more tests this week. A new cancer sign or biohazard symbol tattoo on his wrist next year wouldn't be the worst that could happen. Lake says he doesn't walk around crying or stay up sweating at night. Instead, cancer has concentrated his energy toward what matters most.
The difference she made: Skowronek, her daughter and varsity cheerleader Natalie Skowronek, and about 10 other girls decided to sell the shirts. The issue caused a divide between the school and the community, and resonated throughout the country. The cheer booster club ended up disbanding. The girls collected more than $10,000 for breast cancer research, and are still selling the $15 shirts through saveyourbumps@yahoo.com.

Translation is not an exact process because words have multiple meanings. There are unique idioms and ancient terms. The translator has to choose the correct understanding. The key question for the future is: Does everyone have the ability to read the Bible and interpret it or should this be the work of scholars? If you think it should be scholars, choose Option 1: Only scholars should read the Bible.

So we have: The Pope, Cardinals, Archbishops, Bishops, Monsignors and priests, all men, telling women they can't use birth control medicine. Now! God the Father has the right to decide our fate, but why did he choose an all "bachelor" staff to officiate a woman's destiny? God must have "Inspired" these men with great second hand wisdom because most bachelors are pretty naive when it comes to women.

"The presence of the County Hospital allowed for the extraordinary exclusion of black patients from almost all other hospitals," Ansell wrote.

The bipartisan concord that existed in the House largely disappeared in the Senate, with Republicans nearly united in resisting Democratic efforts to increase investor protections and to attach the Ex-Im Bank bill to the measure.
Our meal for six began with a series of eight cold dishes. All but one I've had on a previous visit - mushrooms with tripe, which had the bleached look and texture of white fungus.

The details: Amid all the candied, overwrought specimens of Zinfandel that have left their original partisans scowling, there's still room for hope. Look no further the 2008 Storybook Mountain Mayacamas Range Estate Napa Valley Zinfandel ($34, 14.7%), a savory, floral take on Napa Zin that smells like plums and tulips in a wooden window box. Jerry Seps is a master of Zin nuance, as this latest example shows. Or look for the 2009 Bucklin Bambino Old Hill Ranch Sonoma Valley Zinfandel ($24, 15.2%), a young-vines effort from one of Sonoma's oldest vineyard sites. It's not only an homage to proper field blends (Petite Sirah, Alicante Bouschet and more appear), but it also offers that perfect mix of bramble fruit and dark pepper spice, with raspberry jam and bay leaf tones. Both are perfect choices for when holiday roasts come out to play.

“You’ve got a situation where you have winners and losers,” said Erik Hansen, former mayor of Thornton, Colo., a small town in the northern Denver suburbs where voters are furious that they won’t get the train service they were promised in the 2004 vote for FasTracks.

"Whether they agree with us or not, at least they can be thinking about it," he said.
It’s a red-meat moment for Red Staters – the visual equivalent of that infamous “You lie!” shout from a congressman at Obama’s health care address in 2009. For those who despise Obama, Brewer is putting that “dictatorial-socialist-Kenyan-born” president in his place. You can be sure Brewer will use the photo in her fundraising and campaign literature.

No place did more to export the idea of the islands back to the mainland than the Moana. From 1935 to 1975, the "Hawaii Calls" radio show broadcast from the hotel's famous Banyan Court. In the early days, Webley Edwards served as the master of ceremonies, reading out the air and water temperatures -- which often closely matched. For snowbound Americans, it sounded like paradise.

Congress will have to approve changes to the tax code, and passing such sweeping legislation could be difficult in an election year. But some of the tax breaks Obama will target expire at the end of the year -- along with the George W. Bush-era tax cuts -- providing impetus for action, possibly when Congress returns late in the year after November's elections.
Hoskins directed "The Raggedy Rawney" (1988), a unique treatise on war and family in which a young soldier (Dexter Fletcher) deserts his post, poses as a mute woman and joins a band of Gypsies. The period seems vaguely World War II-ish, and the country vaguely European, but the military is far from heroic, terrorizing civilians, stealing their supplies and virtually kidnapping their young men. Hoskins plays Darky, leader of the Gypsies, whose objective is to keep the tribe on the move — and free — at all costs.

I remember in 2001, when my father took me to see The Yellow Jackets at The Keswick Theater in Glenside, Pa. It was the first concert I had ever attended that wasn't a high school musical, or a gospel festival.

Instead, speaking at several women-owned businesses with scores of women behind him as a backdrop, Romney hit many of the same themes that he has been for months: what he views as Obama's ineffectual $787-billion government stimulus program, financial regulations that he says have slowed lending and business growth, and a burgeoning deficit that he says has made it difficult for the economy to recover.

* I agree with media colleagues and Mizzou fans that question whether the Arkansas job makes sense for MU coach Mike Anderson. The theory: now that the Arkansas administration has made peace with coaching legend Nolan Richardson, they can keep the peace by just having a friendly relationship. But if Anderson is hired, has problems there, and is eventually fired, then there's a new war with Richardson all over again. I think the theory is a bit paranoid -- simply because Anderson would do well there -- but I understand the point being made here.
"You get kind of beat up after not finding a way to get out of that first round," captain Shane Doan said. "But it's only halfway. We've got to win four more and then regroup again."

A newer entry into the rental market is homes being rented by owners who haven't been able to sell. With information on local rental prices widely available online, these first-time landlords will likely be asking for market prices, says Jed Smith, managing director for quantitative research at the National Association of Realtors. Since their ultimate goal is to sell the property, these landlords may be more serious about maintenance of the property than a landlord who owns multiple properties, he says. So make sure a lease specifies who is responsible for taking care of—and paying for—what.

BPA, which markets power from the federal dams in the region and controls about three quarters of the high-voltage transmission system, has been curtailing production from wind farms during off-peak hours for the past two weeks as a near-record spring runoff has pushed up hydroelectric generation.
And there's Perry, Bachmann and Santorum -- who has pretty much lived in Iowa since last summer and admits he's through if Tuesday goes badly. All three have campaigned relentlessly, hoping for a late surge. The problem is they are all pursuing the same Christian conservatives who carried Huckabee to victory four years ago. That's a very big slice of Iowa's GOP base -- but not split three ways.
Plans at the Hooper Building call for enclosing three automobile bays to add 1,050 square feet and wrapping the second story in a new "skin" of metal panels and windows. The parking lot will be spruced up with new landscaping, bicycle parking and a covered drive-through.

As one of the few reliable advocates of compromise on the right side of the aisle in the Senate, Ms. Snowe acknowledged that she finds it "frustrating ... that an atmosphere of polarization and my-way-or-the-highway ideologies has become persuasive in campaigns and in our governing institutions.

On Sept. 12, 2001, I wrote a letter to The Sun hoping (praying) that my nation would respond to the Sept. 11 attacks with swift justice rather than protracted war; that we would thoughtfully and strategically aim to increase peace rather than compound violence. We've been warring for 10 years now, and at such cost of lives and treasure — over 5,000 American soldiers and many, many times that in civilian deaths and hundreds of billions of dollars.

I can only fall back on the "pause button" theory I read about years ago: Go out and live life to the fullest — but before acting on an impulse, take 20 seconds and consider the implications of what could happen. This is the part that so many teenagers never consider. Until that prefrontal cortex matures, you can only hope that, with repetition, it becomes habit.

Subject: FW: New York Times interview request for Mayor Quan
- Reduces the collective bargaining power of about 360,000 public workers in Ohio. The current collective-bargaining law gives workers the right to negotiate on a broad scope of topics including wages, hours, working conditions and any provision from an expiring contract that an employer wants to change. Under SB 5, workers no longer have the right to bargain changes from a previous contract. Certain topics that have been central to negotiations, such as health care benefits, can’t be bargained anymore. Several other topics can be bargained only if management agrees. These topics, known as “management rights,” include the right to decide employee qualifications, starting and quitting times, work assignments, promotion rules and other topics.
As often happens in these family fights, small ideological or tactical differences take on outsized emotional impact, and whatever happens today, the Democratic Party probably will need some time to heal. But at root, the arguments being made by the heavyweights in the ring -- and despite the best efforts of earnest rookie Graham Veysey, this remains a two-person race -- haven't changed since the moment the new map set up this death match:
A winning exit
Though he shares a famous football name with the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, the retired pharmacist responsible for "The Drugstore List" claims no proprietary information about the NFL Draft. The strength of his rankings lies in his research, his contacts, his core belief that broad consensus trumps his own individual opinion and, at the risk of amateur psychology, a clearly compulsive personality.

Mast had a news conference Thursday to highlight the Sedgwick County case, in which Hussein Hamdeh, a Wichita State University physics professor, filed for a divorce in November 2010 from his wife, Hala.

Woody was charged with those crimes in July, and the case is pending.
I am very disappointed to learn of Parkway's very shortsighted agenda to save money once again by eliminating teaching staff, assistants and others. Some high schools have TVs in the lunch room. Some have cardio machines for a required gym class when it's too cold to walk outside. What happened to team sports in gym glass? How much do cardio machines cost? How many different lunches are offered - like a regular meal, a salad bar, a guest restaurant? There must be three to four different types of meals that are served for lunches at most of the high schools, and two to three at the middle schools. There has to be a way to get back to basics and save the teaching staff. Look for other things to eliminate.
Beldini, a 75-year-old Democrat, was convicted on two of the six corruption counts she faced following a two-week trial in January and, under sentencing guidelines, faced up to four years and three months in jail. The one-time burlesque dancer sat silently during most of Monday's hearing, wearing a white jacket, a black skirt and pearl earrings. Moments before Linares announced her sentence, Beldini told the judge she had never been so afraid. "I stand before you facing the most terrifying moment of my whole life," Beldini said, her voice shaking.

Store owners (and sisters) Lindsay Kroll and Paige Smith established Cake Plate's pop-up shop program to invite national brands to share a section of their boutique for about 10 weeks. "It's a great way to expand the fashion scene of Napa," says Kroll, who opened the boutique in 2007. Trina Turk is the fifth designer to share in the program, joining the list with Benefit Cosmetics, Kirribilla, Leifsdottir and 29 Cosmetics, which received such a positive response that the brand has set up a permanent counter within the boutique.

Christie said he thrust himself into the middle of the redistricting battle because he was there to "support my team."
In August, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta agreed. Florida and 25 other states were suing, but they needed an individual to contest the mandate. "Mary Brown has standing to challenge the individual mandate," the judges said, and "as long as at least one plaintiff has standing to raise" the claim, the court can rule. The Obama administration appealed, and the Supreme Court said in November it would decide the constitutional challenge.
North said all of those shots are memorable but it was much shorter ones that made them so.

None of Sendak's books was a memoir, but all were personal, if only for their celebrations of disobedience and intimations of fear and death and dislocation, sketched in haunting, Blakean waves of pen and ink. "It's a Jewish way of getting through life," Kushner said last fall. "You acknowledge what is spectacular and beautiful and also you don't close your eyes to the pain and the difficulty."
Willow Creek Little League's championship win of Oregon's District 4 tournament in July advanced the team to the Softball World Series, where they will play against nine other teams from across the country and abroad.

Here are a few additional tips to help you eat well at school.
A: You were "walked" to another hotel, which is a fairly common practice in the hotel industry. Hotels sometimes accept more reservations than they can accommodate, anticipating that some guests will cancel.

Unfortunately, recovery of auto sales could take longer. Most European countries, facing gaping budget deficits, are cutting government spending and raising taxes. Such austerity has boosted unemployment to as high as 24% in Spain and 9.8% in Italy. Although they are meant to bring more discipline, these moves have dampened consumer spending.
TRENTON — Gov. Chris Christie, whose pugnacious style and policy victories in the first half of his rookie year made him a hot commodity in the Republican Party, will take his Jersey message on the road this week as he kicks off a month-long national political tour.
Adding a new type of homeless clients could change the way the problem is tackled and add costs.
There were teeny tostada rounds mounded high with diced raw hamachi ringing with lime aioli, pico de Gallo and chile piquin. The meatballs glazed in ancho-cranberry barbecue sauce hid the surprise of melty Oaxaca cheese inside. Tender skewered octopus were most notable for the presentation — the octo-kebab sliced into oblong coins for maximum tentacle crisp-age. The carnitas tacos were tender from their beer, Coke and orange juice braise. Chicken enchiladas came beneath an ebony shine of my new favorite mole poblano, its mysteriously blend of 25 ingredients (from mulatto chiles to hazelnuts, figs, pepitas and tomatillos) in sharper balance than Cantina’s sweeter suburban rendition.
I'm afraid that tarmac delays have set the cause of passenger rights back by decades. It's a shortsighted fascination for which all air travelers will almost certainly suffer.

It appears Streater had been shot while driving and drove his red 2005 Dodge Durango into a home on the 800 block of York Street,a spokesman for the prosecutor said. A passenger in the vehicle, a 31-year-old Camden man, was also shot, but managed to get out and ran to a nearby home to get the residents there to call 9-1-1, spokesman Jason Laughlin said.
Skies will be mostly cloudy Sunday into the early eafternoon, and the high temperature should be in the upper 40s, Dye said. By evening, skies should be mostly clear, and the low temperature will drop into the upper 20s.
We've never quite been believers of UCLA at any point this season. And in spite of Sparty's failings (there have been a lot of them), we did pick them in the preseason as a Final Four team. The fact that Team Izzo seems to be finally turning the corner only encourages us to stay with the decision. Michigan State 62-54.
"We all need to sit down and go over the No. 1 item that we have all agreed - understanding the role of the board of education members," Hodits said.
But it isn't enough. Krymov seems so enamored of his inventive stagings - most of which we've seen handled more creatively by other directors - that he lingers on effects long enough to make us wonder what purpose they serve. Meanwhile, the story goes begging in the streets of Paris, and a mere 80 minutes of theater seems a lot longer.
Several people were recently sentenced to federal prison for their respective roles in an income tax scheme that involved stealing the identities of people who live in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Attorney's Office reported Tuesday.

That’s when the anger set in, Sowell said - when he began “hearing things,” and his rage provoked what he believed were just violent “dreams.”
Most of the local attention has been on the much larger NATO summit - and not what the prime ministers and presidents will be discussing, but on the fortress-like security arrangements being rolled out in Chicago for the diplomats, the peaceful protesters, the rioters if they come and, god forbid, terrorists.
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Graff Diamonds, a high-end jeweler based in London, will seek approval from the Hong Kong stock exchange on Thursday for an initial public offering of as much as $1 billion, two sources with direct knowledge of the plan said.
An ironworkers union leader on hostile terms with New Jersey’s public sector unions, Sweeney initially found much more common ground with Christie — too much, complained some Democrats. But on the issue of taxing the rich to boost a cash-strapped budget — specifically, reinstating a just-expired income tax surcharge on people making more than $400,000 — they were worlds apart.
“They were afraid of what they might lose,” Sasso, 60, said of the retirements. “We couldn’t budget for that kind of mass exodus.”

As the economy improves and CityCenter's reputation develops, perhaps its unusual approach to capitalizing the popularity of the Strip will work and it will prove the power of building residences and not just hotel rooms and casinos. It certainly is an alien idea.

The 2010 healthcare reform law gave states until Jan. 1, 2014, to create "exchanges" in which individuals and small businesses could shop for insurance policies. If the states don't, the federal government will operate exchanges for them. The requirement poses a quandary for lawmakers who oppose the federal law: Should they start working on an exchange, or count on the law being repealed by the Supreme Court or by a new Republican-controlled Congress and White House in 2013? The answer is that each state should set up an exchange regardless of how its lawmakers feel about "Obamacare," because it would help ameliorate the very real problems consumers face in the health insurance market.

Jim White has just released his fourth album, the best of his career and sure to remain, nine months from now, one of the best of 2008. A musically complex collection of 12 distinct songs, "Transnormal Skiperoo" belies its whimsical title by probing big questions about human behavior — Why do we put our faith in superstition? Why do we let our damn minds imprison us? Why do we "let some space case say false is true"? Why do spend much of our lives "turning diamonds to coal" and "counting numbers in the air"? Why are we haunted by a parent in the grave "saying what a useless thing I am"?

But a 20-win season and a potential NCAA berth? That’s cause for excitement around Seton Hall, and if you don’t think so, we hereby offer some perspective: It beats having to go 5,500 miles to slay your final dragon, on the faint hope that someone will notice.
Work on the track, the fourth repave in MIS's 44-year history, began after the August race last year. It was completed in November. About 22,000 tons of asphalt was used, enough to construct about 5 1/2 miles of a two-lane county road.

Dear Mr. Dad: My mother-in-law has an opinion on every conceivable parenting topic. The problem is that those opinions are usually unwelcome and unhelpful.

Your Dec. 22 editorial "The GOP tax hike" could just as easily have been titled "The Democratic tax hike," with the sub-headline: "By rejecting the House's tax-cut extension for one year, which President Obama asked for, the Senate put the U.S. economy at risk."
“Very honestly, we’ve had to postpone some capital needs through the course of the year because we need to, and, rightfully so, manage the expenses appropriately and deal with the economic challenges like anyone else,” he says. “Earlier this year, we did a rightsizing of the organization and we needed to analyze the level of personnel that we had.

The Food 52 Cookbook: The first crowd-sourced cookbook from Food52.com - an online cooking community featuring weekly recipe contests - reads somewhat like a binder of random clippings and margin notes, in the best way. You'll find everything from wild ramp pesto to pudding chomeur, a decadent maple-and cream-soaked baked biscuit (see recipe).

I know next to nothing about astronomy, but still the sky fills me with wonder. The stars linger in the galaxies, fixed on high light years away. They lead me to wonder about the breadth of God's providence and grace. They shine with brilliance, but also mystery.

"There's Something About Mary" (1998): Usually cited as the Farrelly brothers' best movie (though some of us have a soft spot for "Kingpin"), the story follows Ted (Ben Stiller), who has long loved Mary (Cameron Diaz). He gets another shot at dating her 13 years after a hilariously disastrous prom date. But Healy (Matt Dillon), the private detective Ted hires to follow Mary, falls for her, too. What makes the movie work is the stars' willingness to do anything for a laugh; think of the hair-gel scene for proof.

A young Reed college graduate named Albert Gentner enlisted as an ambulance driver in World War I. "My world at present," he wrote in a letter that was eventually published in the Oregonian in 1918, "is a little dug-out about three-fourths of a mile from the front trenches. ...

The two dozen protesters at the state’s World War II Memorial have grievances for Trenton Mayor Tony Mack and President Obama — and lots of people in between.

Other issues included an error message saying the user has been logged out of the online game network.

It's strange to think that for nearly 11 full years, Seton Hall — a program that has gone to two NCAA Tournaments in the time frame — had gone unranked in the Associated Press poll. But coming into Tuesday night's game against DePaul, the Pirates had gone 332 games between their last game as a ranked team (a 70-64 loss at home to Rutgers). Even though the last AP Poll featuring Seton Hall appeared on Jan. 30, 2001, the Pirates played two games before falling out of the poll for good.

It’s hard to believe that only four years ago, Kim was being heralded as a rising star. He won Quail Hollow by five shots for his first PGA Tour win, then won the AT&T National two months later to become the first American under 25 since Tiger Woods to win at least twice in one season. At the Ryder Cup that year, he was catalyst in a rare American victory.
Another argument in favor of raising age limits for judges contends that Ohio has no comparable age limits for other public officials. This ignores the particular circumstances that apply to the environment of the bench, as opposed to other public offices. Compared to other officials, judges lead a somewhat cloistered existence, professionally. While it might become readily apparent to staff and others that an elected official is having difficulty, it might not in the case of a judge, since the average judge has fewer direct contacts.

Overall, these things go in cycles for hoops. While we are fairly steady and/or growing in other sports areas, our basketball is up and down. We have had years in which there have been two guys going to Boston College (wow!) and others in which there have been none above the D-II level. A lot of it is reflective of our population and location. The Rocky Mountains have rarely been a hoops mecca or factory. But it would be nice if it was, wouldn't it?

Jasper's Corner Tap & Kitchen, on its nondescript edge of the Tenderloin's lodging zone, seems on quick glance to be another by-numbers hotel effort. Yet here's a confluence of Bar Stars: Kevin Diedrich, whose work at the Burritt Room caught our attention last year, and Brian MacGregor, whose concoctions at Jardiniere earned him the honor in 2010. When I walked in on a recent night, both were working - a critical mass of cocktail talent.
All four of Koschman's friends - Scott Allen, James Copeland, David Francis and Shaun Hageline - told the police they are willing to take lie-detector tests. Vanecko's friends would not agree to be interviewed again by the police, instead standing by the statements they gave in 2004, in which they all said they didn't see who punched Koschman.
TR: Lance, when I got done, came up to me and just started telling me about how effective my fastball could be for me and how that pitch alone was going to be hard for guys to hit, but people will start to sit on that and that's when I need the curveball or something that I know I can throw in for a strike. Having that pitch was going to be important for me. It was a little thing like that, a thing that I already know and had already heard, but when it comes from a player like that it hits home a little bit harder.

If it comes to communication with funders and the art world about the project, I'd give him an A+," said Lowe, founder of Project Row Houses in Houston.

Gregory Maguire's Oz is not the Oz we all know from the movie (and let's face it, that's our point of reference - how many of us have slogged through L.

Since the kickoff of summer, I have thought to myself, "Ugh… I need a tan." I also began thinking how much easier life would be hundreds of years ago in Europe when being incredibly pale was the "in" thing.

One of the things that I have found helpful is remembering that forgiveness is not the same as forgetting. Forgiveness does not mean everything can go back to the way it was before someone injured you. We do not need to let people back into our lives as a result of forgiving them. Nor do we need to say to them, "It does not matter that you injured me." That is not forgiveness. When we forgive, we learn how to cut off the tentacles of hurt that have wrapped themselves tightly into our souls. We give up that hurt.

Thanks to all those who planned and designed and had the vision to make it happen.
A: Oh yeah, absolutely. I'm not worried about results so much anymore. I was going through that slump there for a while and worrying about results and pressing and wanting to stay in the lineup and thinking I could only stay in the lineup if I could hit. All that negative thought process just buries you even more. I quit worrying about that about a week ago and the results came. I got a few hits in a game, a few RBIs and stuff. In the grand scheme of things looking back, I don't even worry about that anymore. The numbers are going to be what they are at the end of the year. They're not going to be terrible, they're not going to be the best in the league. I'm not worrying about it, I'm just trying to get a routine down and stick with it.
"And the beer gardens such as Darley Park — writer H.L. Mencken's favorite — were part of the family culture. That was very striking to me," he said.

There are only four mechanical buttons on the device, all Lumia and they're all lined up on the edge of the Lumia to the right of the screen. The bad news: they're unlabeled, and they're identical. It's easy to suss that the two that are buttressed together are the volume buttons. But every time I wanted to wake the phone I'd guess incorrectly and press the camera shutter instead.

The crowd, of course, was right there with him. The bigger question: Was the band on board? Jane's broke up in 1991 at the height of its popularity and fought during several failed reunions over the next two decades.

"That's My Boy": After watching Adam Sandler go to broad slapstick extremes to play his twin sister in "Jack and Jill," those memories of him stretching his acting skills in "Punch-Drunk Love" are fading fast. But the "Saturday Night Live" veteran's next project could be inspired silliness, especially because it will pit him against a new-generation "SNL" star.

He had named the four corners of his bed after four cinemas of Rimini, his birthplace on the Adriatic coast. True to his childhood self, he later was to regard his films as dreams on celluloid. His sketchbooks were partly a record of possible film ideas. One sketch has the worried annotation, "Have I just let a film idea escape while engaged in my usual neurotic masturbatory fantasies?"

øCombat plays the most significant role, however, with many powerful weapons to wield - from guns, grenades and crossbows to boomerang-like Wingsticks and RC Bomb Cars that can detonate nearby enemies.

Lest you assume all visually and acoustically isolating seating to be a product of the iPod age, behold the Canopy Chair. It's a reproduction of a "porter's chair," which hails from the 16th century. Back in the day, the hall porter would hunker down in one of these; the high seat back and sides protected him from front-door drafts, while the hooded headrest helped him stay attuned to distant sounds. Its signature headrest is just as practical today. The "hoodie" is kind of like holding your hands up to your ears: In noisy environments, it makes conversations more intelligible; in quieter places, chatting with someone feels more intimate. If the burlap and exposed brass nailheads of this reproduction aren't your style, there are other equivalents.

This was her second trip to KU. She made her maiden voyage last spring. It was then she realized just how enormous the meet is and how intimidating it can be. She said the larger stadium, crowd, video board and gabbing announcers were tough to deal with her first time through.
Meanwhile, Houston's daughter was transported by ambulance to a Los Angeles hospital Sunday morning and later released. A source close to the family who did not want to speak given the sensitivity of the matter said she was treated and released for stress and anxiety.

The Irvine Company, which owns and operates Fashion Island, announced in December renovations to its seven-screen multiplex. That was a surprise to organizers of the Newport Beach Film Festival, who were planning to screen the majority of their 300-plus films at Edwards Island Cinemas, as they have since 2000.

These images and memories will stay with us forever.
Decades later these two men, who had never met, became, respectively, a doctor and a nutrition researcher.

A: Hey, Brian: Massaquoi missed a lot of work, but the good news is he worked with McCoy and the other skill position players in the four Camp Colts during the lockout. So he's not coming in entirely out of the cold. I think he will benefit from the switch to the West Coast system. As for Pinkston, we will only find out during the regular-season games. I do think the Browns will be looking for a guard with experience -- just in case. Billy Yates would look real good right now.

Mutter's award was presented by her former husband, composer Andre Previn. She accepted musically, with a rendition of Gershwin. Ban's award was presented by Henry Kissinger. The secretary general called attention to the turmoil in Syria, receiving applause for saying, "There can be no compromise on issues of justice or human rights."
All that notwithstanding, it is a strange time in history for self-appointed advocates for women to feel oppressed on their behalf. They must have missed the growing literature on "The End of Men" and similar themes. Women earn about 60 percent of bachelor's and master's degrees, and are reaching parity with men in medical and law schools. Their attitudes to work are changing. In a historic reversal, more young women ages 18 to 34 (66 percent) than young men (59 percent) say high-paying work is one of the most important things or very important, according to a new Pew survey.
Conclusive scientific evidence supports a low-fat, plant-based diet for optimal health. Peer-reviewed studies find that people who avoid meat cut their risk of obesity, diabetes and heart disease -- the No. 1 cause of death in America.

Not, say, the fisheries minister? No, a metal band singer and a high-energy defender of Faroese customs, who has appeared on a "Viking Shores" episode and wrote an anti-Sea Shepherd song called "Rainbow Warrior" (which includes the lyric: "May your ship sink"). Just another odd twist in an already nuanced conflict.

Her research on her daughter's condition is even more thorough and aggressive as Michael recovers in a rehab unit. (Michael passed away in August, after this book was completed.) Didion reads neurology textbooks, inhabits a surgically precise idiom like an A student at medical school, snaps commands and reminders at doctors and orderlies, looks to these potent words and slabs of information as bulwarks against the dilating pain of helplessness and loss.
Ficano's appointees work for the county in a variety of roles, including running departments, outreach programs and the like. They're all paid with public dollars -- about half of his 187 appointees last year made $100,000 or more.
In Oak Grove, the question on everyone's mind is "Who approved closing our library, and why didn't we know about it until now?" The easy answer is that in 2008 the county commissioners, led by Lynn Peterson, decided to abandon the library in Oak Grove because the community is not an incorporated city. When the voters approved a tax increase to support the new library district, few were aware that Oak Grove was once again being ignored.

A month after Christie’s announcement, members of the public broadcasting authority have received no detailed blueprint for the split, although state officials have met with interim NJN executive director Howard Blumenthal. Christie’s proposal includes leaving $2 million for the rest of 2010 — and the slashing of 129 NJN employees from the state payroll come Jan. 1, 2011.

Let us not go too far. Let us not get overly carried away. The pope may call the LCWR "radical," but that's a bit like the NRA calling a guy with only nine shotguns a liberal. It's a relative scale, to be sure. They are still wildly devout Catholics; their radicalism, in the larger view, is about as extreme as ordering a glass of wine at a NASCAR rally.

At a time when sex is viewed more widely than ever as recreational rather than procreational; when factory jobs have been triple-teamed by hostile environmental policies, overpriced homegrown labor and underpriced illegal immigrants; when we've made a college degree a requirement for just about anything that pays above the minimum wage; and when government policies encourage women to let the state be their mate, why trust a man?

Coleman reached his zenith of power at exactly the time when the political bombshell of abortion landed in American politics.

San Jose city leaders are so far considering something short of a total ban or cap. If the current proposal is recommended to the City Council on May 15, new applicants would not be allowed to move into low-income neighborhoods but could open elsewhere in the city. They would have to stay only 500 feet from other payday lending establishments -- not the 1,000 feet or more required in other cities that have tried to rein in payday lending. And there would be no limits on their proximity to liquor stores, bars and "adult" businesses.
Mr. Melentyev and Martin Fridson, global credit strategist at BNP Paribas Investment Partners, say a reasonable expectation for total return on junk over the next 12 months is 7% to 8%.

Two words of warning, though, to any prospective employer. The first is that the doubts, introspection and self-analysis will likely follow Guardiola wherever he goes.

A 6-foot-2 forward, Rigg didn't perform well the past two years on teams that Binning said were a bit on the self-centered side.

Among the stranger economic tenets of conservatism, which Paul Krugman argues against ("Bombs, bridges and jobs," November 1), is that government can't create jobs.

And despite the fact that pastors never work harder than during this week-four sermons in four days, anyone?-I suspect most of my fellow clergy would feel the same way. Holy Week is the reason we do this. Jesus' suffering, death, and resurrection is the heart of Christian faith. Without it, we'd have no reason to get together at all.

SDS President Jason Spadaro said the project was not currently feasible. Uncertainty over the renewal of the federal production tax credit, which expires at the end of 2012, means few new wind projects are going forward. California's new limits on renewable power imports have also slowed development in the Northwest. Finally, Spadaro said the state's decision to scale back the project undermined its economics.

Michigan State is a No. 1 seed with No. 14 charm. Its star, Draymond Green, is the best all-around player in the tournament. It was priceless to see him dribble the ball while getting instructions from Izzo in the final minutes of yesterday’s gutcheck win over St. Louis.
One of McMillan's weaknesses is that players view him as controlling. His Blazers teams have been methodical and careful in their play. He typically has called the offensive sets from the sideline. You know, the whole "Sarge" persona.

That story blended in my mind with the one about 12-year-old Michael Green II being shot on a basketball court near his home. Michael, according to news reports, was frightened by men who drove up pretty fast in a black car. He said he left the court, but not before he felt a pain in his arm.

Browns daughters  Susie, Katie and Fiona, 6, 4 and 2 years old at the time  arrived in time to start school in January. Brown recalled that first school day: There was an ice storm, and his wife and the girls were walking up and down the street in the freezing weather, looking for the school bus. A neighbor came out, he said, and mercifully told them they could wait inside, where it was warm. The bus would come, right to their house.

"It was just one night," Braun said. "There's no doubt this is one of the more challenging if not the most challenging place to hit home runs in the league. I think for fans, you want to see offense. Offense is exciting when teams are scoring runs. It's a lot of fun for the fans to watch. So I think if they did do that, it would make it more of a neutral ballpark. As of right now it certainly favors pitchers pretty substantially."

WEDNESDAY MAY 2
Young musicians are battling uphill. With each passing year, the "buzz" musicians at the conference get older and more established. Claire Boucher, the 24-year-old singer-songwriter who performs under the name Grimes, was typical of past artists who have distinguished themselves at the festival: fashionable, experimental, somewhat opaque and still very much under construction. But veteran crooner Lionel Richie, whose public image was cast in bronze decades ago, played one of the week’s best received concerts.

Let's zero in on what I consider the most important group: bargain hotels. As with overall bests, separate lists cover the world, the United States, the same seven regions, and most of the same 30 individual countries. Here, the world's top spot is the HueNino in Hue, Vietnam -- a result that many of us who knew the Vietnam War as a national nightmare will no doubt find ironic.

The Linear PCM 2.0 mono track fares about the same. Some age related hissing and popping are fairly consistent, but never distracting.

As of this printing, this is THE definitive home video release of A STAR IS BORN.

Obviously we can build on this momentum, but we let another one slip out of our fingers. I’m proud of the way the guys fought considering we had guys who came to the stadium today and didn’t even know they were going to play and stepped right in and filled in and didn’t miss a beat. But it still hurts though."

We expect those guys to show us what they have. Hopefully, they will do that.”

The Sept. 21 and 22 shows at MetLife Stadium conflict with another major music event taking place in the Garden State that weekend: All Tomorrow's Parties in Asbury Park. There is not likely to be too much overlap between the ATP audience and the Springsteen crowd, but the Boss has been reaching many younger listeners with "Wrecking Ball" -- which made its debut atop the Billboard 200 -- and his star turn at South By Southwest has helped re-establish him as a musician whose moves tastemakers cannot ignore. Don't be surprised if many ATP fans find themselves torn.
While the Kirkland has all of the characteristics that make New Zealand sauvignon blanc unique, it's on the tamer end of the spectrum. A zesty, flavorful wine, it's much softer and easier to drink. It has a clean, minerally aroma with layers of zippy lemon, lime and grapefruit flavors. This is a crisp, medium-bodied white with a 13.5 percent level of alcohol and a refreshing acidity. It goes well with the pasta and asparagus recipe and also makes a good pair with fish and chicken.

During the phone interview with a Blue Cross representative, I was asked if I have an undescended testicle or a malignancy in or near one; have used a penile implant; or plan testicular surgery, infertility treatments or related procedures. I answered no to all of those queries. What was the "underlying cause" of the erectile dysfunction?

I also told the interviewer that the doctor prescribed both a daily testosterone supplement and the use of Cialis or Viagra. My subsequent physicians have continued that treatment, I said.

After more than 12 years as a trial court and court of appeals judge, and more years than that being tangentially involved with judicial issues as an attorney, I firmly believe that all seven justices on our state Supreme Court -- including those up for election this year, Justices Stephen Markman and Brian Zahra -- are experienced, principled individuals with stellar reputations. Although they may disagree on many important cases, those disagreements result from differing legal views, not from who is before the court.

In the vaguest of terms, there's a similarity to Rowling's saga. Morgenstern's novel also centers on two dueling magicians, one of whom is difficult to pin down by name. The pawns in their odd, extended game are several sweet, young innocents who struggle to uncover their own destinies just like Harry and his friends.

some expected based on the 18 games the Cardinals and Brewers played against each other the regular season. A few of those became beanball exchanges, and all of them had a certain edge.

Most likely to contribute early: Kelechi Osemele. The Ravens waited until the second day of the draft to finally address their most pressing offseason need: the offensive line. They lost Ben Grubbs in free agency and missed out on Evan Mathis, who re-signed with the Philadelphia Eagles, leaving a big question mark at left guard. This versatile, athletic lineman will compete for a spot in the starting lineup right away, either battling Jah Reid for the left guard spot or getting in the mix at tackle (he would be a right tackle, but there are potentially moving parts there in Bryant McKinnie and Michael Oher).

For example, some have suggested that that the public option go into effect only in those markets where insurance companies are not providing affordable policies. Others propose a co-op or another non-profit entity to administer the plan. These are all constructive ideas worth exploring.

With spring comes the promise of garden tomatoes, if we're patient. Perhaps we needn't be as patient as in the past, though.

Broadnax shot back, "So, you're asking us to sit back and not do what the county executive has charged us to do? Let the assessor arbitrarily raise people's tax liabilities and then pawn it off on the state?"
But it never seems to come easy. The scenario this time was nearly a carbon copy of the outcome Monday, when the Blues scored in the third period to win 1-0. This time, they waited even longer to hit a vein, getting Alex Pietrangelo's goal with 5:14 remaining in regulation. All the nice home records aside, Blues coach Ken Hitchcock realizes his team is skating a fine line.
Completely eliminating gluten from your diet can be challenging because gluten is found in many common foods, including bread, pasta, cookies and pizza crusts, just to name a few.

Smyly took advantage of the reprieve, settled down, and didn't give up another hit until the seventh inning -- a soft flare by Rodriguez. Leyland pulled Smyly at that point, but not because of shrinking velocity or control. He wanted to protect his young pitcher, just as he used to do with Justin Verlander, not that Leyland was comparing Smyly's stuff to Verlander's.
The conversation lasted no more than five minutes: Pritchett introduced himself, offered his badge and business card, and explained that although he typically focused on national security and terrorism, public corruption and white-collar crime were also Justice Department priorities.

Almost to a witness, the argument for same-sex marriage was the same: anecdotal stories relating embarrassing encounters with people in New Jersey and other states who were ignorant of the significance of a civil union; or an institution’s computerized system did not have the ability to register same-sex civil union couples and, in doing so, denied various civil union couples their due recognition.
UpTo, of course, could fail to reach critical mass and die a death like thousands of other digital start-ups.

Grass' wartime past is certainly troublesome. Yet it does little to undercut the power of his anti-fascist novels (including the 1959 masterpiece "The Tin Drum"), nor does it imply that there is anything anti-Semitic about his poem. There isn't; it's a polemic about Israeli policies with which Grass disagrees. For Israelis to accuse him of anti-Semitism plays into a common belief that such accusations are a mere excuse to suppress dissent against official policy.

That would bump the already robust 1.75 percent income tax rate to 2.25 percent, generating an estimated $6 million more per year. Shaker gives a slight credit to those who work in another city and pay income taxes there. If you work in Cleveland and pay the 2 percent there, for example, you pay another 1.25 percent to Shaker. That ranks the income tax tab for Shaker residents among the highest in the region, even before a new tax.

I can't wait to start moving forward from this and once again start accentuating all the positives we have going in the Millburn Schools."

Talk about a fun wine: Its color made me think of the cherry Lifesavers I loved as a kid. But don't be misled by the hue. Although it tastes of cherries and strawberries, this is not a sweet wine. It's dry - but not bone dry - and it has a refreshing citrusy finish that's great for the summer. It also has a bit more body than some rosés, making it a nice option for red wine lovers seeking a chilled wine for al fresco dining on a warm afternoon.

The problem: Kennedy had defied military censors to get the story out. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Harry Truman had agreed to suppress news of the capitulation for a day, in order to allow Russian dictator Josef Stalin to stage a second surrender ceremony in Berlin.

As it got dark, I wondered how we were going to get home. This felt oddly similar to the walks we took as kids, but this time if we were to call our parents to pick us up, I am sure they would laugh at us, then scream when the international charges showed up on the next phone bill.

The justices strongly suggested Wednesday that they are ready to let Arizona enforce the most controversial part of its law, a requirement that police officers check the immigration status of people they suspect are in the country illegally.

Now, as I was reading the administration's foreign aid proposal, I couldn't help thinking -- taking a line from columnist Lluis Bassets of the Spanish daily El Pais in a recent article about how the Obama administration looks at Europe -- that Obama does not see Latin America as a problem, nor as a region that can help solve any problems.

The Clippers sounded annoyed and dedicated to improving themselves in the next nine days. And I know the bar has been much higher in prior years with the Blazers (read: trying to beat the Los Angeles team with all the world titles), but Portland is a more experienced, more complete team than the Clippers and should be 4-0 today save for dribbling the ball off their feet, or throwing it out of bounds in front of all those horrified people.

The back story: Prana has been so consistently popular that it's hard to remember it was a restaurant, La Mezzanine, until 2001. Today it's Ybor City's only five-story nightclub. The first two floors (and the roof) are hip-hop and reggae; the third floor is Prana's "Sanctuary," a dark, chilled-out VIP lounge with an aquarium and more private bar; the fourth floor is a packed, sweaty dance hall.

While Russo plays cuts by major label acts — he was the first deejay in the country to spin Pearl Jam’s 2009 single "Just Breathe" — his heart belongs to the true independent artists. Russo is community-minded, and he takes his commitment to airing music alternatives seriously. While he didn’t initially know how to transform that mission into action on "Anything Anything," he feels like he’s now on the right track.

At a Johannesburg news conference Monday, officials from the International Finance Corporation, which is part of the World Bank group, and The MasterCard Foundation said they would spend $37.4 million over five years to support banks and other institutions across Africa that provide small loans, a strategy known as microfinancing.

(05-01) 04:29 PDT MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) --
The city struggles to adapt to its peculiar topology and legacies of industrial pollution while seeking to be a steward of prominent natural resources such as the Sandy and Columbia rivers. In particular, Troutdale has shown itself to be a smart player in managing some nasty brownfield sites whose hard use preceded environmental regulation by decades. A prime example is the conversion of the former Alcoa aluminum plant campus near I-84, once a toxic Superfund site, to the current FedEx regional hub -- a sensible, comparatively clean and profitable use of the land.
"You are standing on the floor telling me a bill is going to get corrected in the House?" Green said. "Senator please tell me I did not hear that."

One hopeful sign is the 53% increase in the number of banks availing themselves of the loans. That suggests many smaller banks across the Continent participated for the first time. Such banks tend to be more focused than larger ones on lending to small and midsize businesses, so that possibly could hasten the trickle-down effect of the ECB cash.
James "Buck" Duke, a tobacco magnate who founded Duke University, purchased 40 farms near the Raritan River to fulfill his dream of a pastoral estate near New York City. He hired Frederick Olmsted's civil engineer, James Greenleaf, to design what was one of the earliest and most prominent examples of lagoon landscaping, with interconnecting canals and lakes providing the estate's water. Two million trees and shrubs were planted, and 35 fountains modeled after those Mr. Duke saw in Europe were installed.
Just as people have grown understandably indisposed toward anything political, Clooney directed, produced, co-wrote and starred in the election drama "The Ides of March." Rather than play the candidate any number of people wish he were (Clooney says he's not interested in actually running for office), the actor's "Ides of March" presidential contender is about as honorable as John Edwards. And while starring in an Alexander Payne movie might initially appear risk-free, the film's cuckolded protagonist is not necessarily the type of character Clooney's peers would fight to play, and it proved to be a part Clooney said concerned him no end. "I was terrified from the moment it started," he says.
Among the play’s many head-scratchers is why Karen latches onto the doughy, bland Danny instead of his rebel-without-a-cause friend Jake (Dennis Staroselsky). Another is why Pop never seems to be around, even in the dead of night, or why the superfluous Shirley (Erin Darke) and Benji (Devin Ratray) couldn’t have gone the way of Fritz.

It may be a prejudice, but people are continually surprised to find this caliber of restaurant in the Westin Hotel on Third Street just off Market. I can't tell you how many times people have written me to let me know they were skeptical but became converts after tasting Richard Corbo's take on rustic Venetian-inspired food. His specialties include a stellar sformato, a dense souffle made with lobster and ground polenta when I visited; perfectly done arancini (risotto balls); and halibut cheeks with polenta and jalapeno-mint marinara. With a sexy interior and one of the best outdoor spaces in the city, it's a great addition to the dining scene.
Kevin Walsh of the Fair Share Housing Center – one of the group’s challenging parts of the October decision — said while the state no longer faces a deadline, the part of the appellate court’s order that would force Department of Community Affairs Commissioner Lori Grifa to update the court on the council’s progress in drawing up new rules should still stand.

The total cost of obesity to U.S. employers is $13 billion per year, according to the University of Michigan Health Management Research Center. The university also reports that job stress costs $200 billion to $300 billion annually in lost productivity, tardiness and absenteeism. A 2003 study by HR specialists Ceridian Corp. found that corporate wellness initiatives cut short-term sick leave by as much as 32 percent. And according to a study by the Federal government's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, a good corporate wellness program will result in $3 to $6 saved for every dollar spent.

The disease is insidious and deadly. Though listed as only the seventh-leading cause of death in 2006, it's believed to be dramatically under-reported as a cause - contributing to many more. It's also expensive. Medical costs for people with diabetes are 2.3 times higher than for those without diabetes, government data show.
In November, Toyota issued a separate recall of 4.2 million vehicles due to a risk of the driver-side floor mat trapping the gas pedal. That recall affects the following models: the 2007-2010 model year Toyota Camry, 2005-2010 Toyota Avalon, 2004-2009 Toyota Prius, 2005-2010 Tacoma, 2007-2010 Toyota Tundra, 2007-2010 Lexus ES350 and the 2006-2010 Lexus IS250/IS350.
øHeavy stock trading can present some benefits to investors. For instance, the more buying and selling in a stock, the closer the bid and ask price of a stock gets. That's a technical way of saying that when investors buy or sell a heavily traded stock, they tend to get a more fair price. It's just as when you sell an item on eBay. If many people are bidding on the product, as a seller, you're more likely to get a price that's closer to what the object is actually worth than if only one person is bidding.

As early as 1605, the British Crown coveted the trees of New England for use building heavy wooden warships; the pine trees served as masts. More than 300 years later, the forests became fodder in building 10,000 Allied planes, in part from American spruce, to fly in the Great War.
Ms. Suu Kyi's comments go the heart of a central question asked by international leaders—whether a range of liberalizing moves over the past year by Myanmar's government are genuine and likely to survive over the long term. Western governments are closely watching Sunday's vote, which will fill around 45 of the more than 600 seats in Myanmar's parliament, as an indicator of whether to begin easing major economic sanctions in place for years to punish Myanmar's secretive military regime. U.S. and European leaders have said they would be willing to lift some sanctions soon, possibly as early as next month, if the vote is seen as free and fair.

Let's also stipulate that Mr. Nighy is one of the great comic actors of any time. Here, however, he's a glum presence in a role of bleak passivity. Ms. Smith spends most of her screen time in a wheelchair, complaining nastily about everything under the Jaipur sun. Dev Patel has been encouraged, or allowed, by the director, John Madden, to overact wildly and wave his arms grotesquely as the hotel's desperate young proprietor. Only Ms. Dench gets to play a scene worthy of her gifts. Her character, Evelyn Greenslade, has gone out and hustled herself a job at an Indian call center; suddenly she's plunged into the witty give and take of teaching a young Indian woman how to keep a client on the line. The scene is about listening well, thinking quickly and responding creatively. Unlike the rest of this inert film, it's alive.
John Beck, who lives alone, was pronounced dead at the scene by the Morris County medical examiner.
The wine is a deliciously rich, flavorful rosé with an alcohol level of 14 percent and a surprising amount of depth and body. It's made by bleeding lightly colored juice from the skins of fermenting old-vine malbec grapes. This is a rosé for red wine drinkers, rather than a lightweight, strawberry-flavored aperitif. Although it's dry, it isn't bone dry, and it has flavors of zesty cranberries laced with spice. Best served with food, the Crios Rosé of Malbec is a versatile wine that would be great with turkey and cranberry sauce, grilled chicken or even spicy Asian dishes.
School officials shepherded high school students across the campus to Maple Elementary School, where their parents could pick them up. The FBI and police interviewed students who witnessed the shootings before letting them go home.
There's no question that, in any number of ways, government lets us down. Our leaders have too often stacked government against the interests of working people in favor of corporate elites. But was it overpaid and undertaxed CEOs who saved flood victims or rushed into the towers? Our impulse should not be to renounce government; it should be to recapture and restore it.

Allen sent a messenger to Pritchard months before he was fired, saying he was no longer welcomed to sit next to him at Rose Garden games.
